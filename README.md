# Ocean Colonization: Humanity’s Lifeboat

## Overview
Humanity needs an insurance policy against extinction. While space colonization dominates headlines, the ocean has already proven itself as life’s refuge — sustaining species through multiple mass extinctions.  

This project presents a step-by-step roadmap for ocean colonization as a survival imperative. It begins with food security pilots and scales toward permanent underwater colonies.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 2 – Food Security Pilot:** Automated kelp labs to prove food in the ocean is infinite.  
- **Phase 3 – Life Support & Energy Systems:** Oxygen extraction and current-powered energy systems to prove independence from the surface.  
- **Phase 4 – Reverse Fishbowl Dome:** Semi-deep dome habitat demonstrating survivability in underwater environments.  
- **Phase 5 – Deep Access & Pressure Management:** Pressurized shuttles and docking systems for safe human transfer to deeper habitats.  
- **Phase 6 – Permanent Colonies:** Networked underwater habitats as extinction-resilient civilizations.
